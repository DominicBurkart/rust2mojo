## 🚀 Working Compiler

The basic compiler is functional and can handle simple Rust code:

```bash
# Compile Rust to Mojo
cargo run -- compile input.rs --stdout

# Example output for `fn main() { let x = 42; }`
# Generated Mojo code from Rust source
from memory import UnsafePointer
from collections import List

fn main():
    pass
```

## 🧪 Comprehensive Testing

### Test Categories
- **Contract Tests**: 15+ fundamental compiler invariants
- **Language Spec Tests**: Systematic validation against Rust reference
- **Fuzzing Tests**: Property-based robustness testing
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end pipeline validation

### Quality Metrics
- All contract tests passing ✅
- Comprehensive error handling ✅
- No-panic guarantee on any input ✅
- Deterministic compilation ✅

## 🔍 LLM Validation Framework

Unique comparison system that validates rust2mojo output against LLM-generated code:

```rust
let engine = ComparisonEngine::new(config);
let result = engine.compare(rust_code).await?;

// Metrics: structural, semantic, performance similarity
println!("Overall score: {:.2}%", result.metrics.overall_score * 100.0);
```

### Features
- **Quantitative Analysis**: Structural, semantic, and performance metrics
- **Qualitative Assessment**: Advantages, improvements, correctness issues
- **Batch Processing**: Analyze multiple test cases systematically
- **Detailed Reports**: Comprehensive analysis with actionable insights

## 🛠️ Development Ready

### Quick Start
```bash
# Setup development environment
make dev-setup

# Run all tests
make ci

# Test specific categories
make test-contracts test-spec test-fuzz

# Run LLM comparison demo
cargo run --example comparison_demo --features comparison
```

### Quality Gates
